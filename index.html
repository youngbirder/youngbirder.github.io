    <h2 id="whoiam">Who I Am</h2>
    
    <p id="who-i-am">Hi! My name is Coco and I am a 15-year-old bird, insect, and wildlife lover. I spend plenty of time with nature and go birding in many hotspots. I am currently based out of Boston, United States for high school, but I am from Shanghai, China. I started birding in March 2021 when I visited Singapore and saw the awesome bird <em>Javan Myna</em>, which is also my spark bird (i.e. the bird that inspired my journey of birding). I take photos of nature with my camera and I've been posting my favorite photos on Instagram since March/April 2021. Check out my Instagram profile @<a target="_blank" href=https://www.instagram.com/youngbirder_coco/>youngbirder_coco</a>. I've also been uploading my photos to Photocrowd, a community for professional and amateur photographers, since August 2021. You can find my Photocrowd profile at <a target="_blank" href=https://www.photocrowd.com/photographer-community/336995/>https://www.photocrowd.com/photographer-community/336995/</a>. And lastly, I keep an eBird list to track my lifers (i.e. birds I see for the first time in my life). Visit my eBird profile at <a target="_blank" href=https://ebird.org/profile/MjM0ODY5Mw>https://ebird.org/profile/MjM0ODY5Mw</a>. Birding brought me unimaginable joy and growth during the current pandemic. I can't wait to continue this journey and keep on improving my photography skills. </p>
    
    <h2 id="whatido">What I Do</h2>
    
    <p id="what-i-do">In a simple sentence, I use my free time to go birding and take photos of nature. Yes, that's what I do as a young birder and wildlife photographer. But birding is definitely not an easy hobby. Sometimes during the summer, I had to bird in the heat of over 35°C (95°F), which means my findings are extremely precious to me personally. I remembered the morning when I got up at 6:30 and spent an hour and a half in the woods just to get a satisfying video of a Wood Thrush singing. Once there were aggressive mosquitos in the ecosystems where I visited. You can imagine what happened to me: I got bitten all over and the itching did not stop until four days later. But none of these can ever stop me from birding, because I find myself inseparable from birds. I've always been grateful to nature for creating such incredible creatures. They mesmerize me. For this summer (2021), I am living in Connecticut, USA. I have been birding in many hotspots here in Connecticut such as Hammonassett Beach State Park, Barn Island Wildlife Management Area, Harkness State Memorial Park, and Rocky Neck State Park, just to name a few. The table below will hopefully give you a sense of the countries I've birded in and my findings: </p>

                <tr>
                    <th>Country</th>
                    <th>Number of Observed Species</th>
                    <th>States/Province/Region
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>United States</td>
                    <td>92</td>
                    <td>CT, MA</td>
                </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>Singapore</td>
                    <td>12</td>
                    <td>SG</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

    <p id="future">In the next few years, I plan to bird mainly in two countries, China and the United States. In China, I hope to go to Baihualing, the place where nearly 460 species of birds have been sighted. I will surely be fascinated by the dense forests and the huge biodiversity there. I will also spend more time in Shanghai Botanical Garden, a large hotspot for birds which is only 10 minutes away from where I live in Shanghai. For now, I will continue to bird in the United States, specifically on the East Coast (where my school is), until summer comes when I will return to China. As I grow older, I also plan to visit countries in Central and South America such as Brazil, Costa Rica, and Ecuador for the tropical birds there. Visiting Papua New Guinea has been part of my dream too because of the birds of paradise there. </p>
